===============
This is just a small application I've put together to test javascript TDD using jasmine and coffeescript. There is a
small sinatra application mostly existing to automatically compile my coffeescript into javascript.

Instructions
============
Test the server with "rspec spec"

Run the server with "ruby server.rb" or "jruby server.rb" (only tested with jruby)

Run the [jasmine tests](http://localhost:4567/test)

Run the [demo](http://localhost:4567/demo)

Things to do
============
1.  Make it compatible with bundler
2.  Come up with some objects & interfaces
3.  Test the objects and interfaces
4.  Build into a demo
